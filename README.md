#Artfolio 

In 2023, having an interest in codeless website builders and sharing my art, I built a tool that allowed people to build their own art portfolio websites. The tool allowed users to customize and build their own websites with their own custom backgrounds, profile pictures, art works and links.
This project was built in NextJS and Firebase with use of cloud functions to allow users to host their sites from their own domain names. This web app reached over 50 users, generated sales and reached over 100 000 views on Reddit.  


Artfolio had 2 seperate versions, one with limited functionality written in ReactJS, and one with expanded functionallity in NextJS, this repository is the NextJS edition
